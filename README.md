# Common things

## Deployed via github-pages https://aragor89.github.io/common-things

## In this small app you can find some typical tasks implementation, such as...

1. Sing in/sign up (please use some fake credentials to sign up, then use the same login and pass to sign in, in order to have access to the other pages).
   Here locale storage serves as the server for storing credentials.
   Please remember about the form validation.

2. Fetching data via API for the game 'Alias' which data is stored in the google sheets.
   Please check out the game. It is fun and educative.

3. Creating, reading, deleting, toggling, filtering..., these you can find in 'todo' page which again uses the local storage as a server for storing data. Please check out its features.

### Also if you are familiar with end2end testing you may find interesting the integration of Cypress, which you can find in the root directory of the project.
